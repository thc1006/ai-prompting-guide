## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to: [Create a security contact email]
3. Include the following information:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
   - Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution Target**: 
  - Critical: 7 days
  - High: 14 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: 60 days

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Dependencies**
   - Run `npm audit` before submitting PRs
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Avoid dependencies with known vulnerabilities

2. **Code Security**
   - Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords, tokens)
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations
   - Implement proper error handling without exposing system details

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Use secure session management
   - Implement proper CSRF protection
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Follow the principle of least privilege

### For Users

1. **Deployment Security**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Configure proper CSP headers
   - Enable security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Keep the application and dependencies updated

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Rotate secrets regularly
   - Use strong, unique passwords

## Security Features

### Current Implementation

- Input validation and sanitization
- XSS protection through content sanitization
- CSRF token generation and validation
- Security headers configuration
- Rate limiting capabilities
- Secure cookie settings

### Planned Enhancements

- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Add automated security scanning in CI/CD
- [ ] Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Add security logging and monitoring
- [ ] Implement API authentication
- [ ] Add two-factor authentication support

## Security Checklist for Releases

Before each release, ensure:

- [ ] All dependencies are up to date
- [ ] `npm audit` shows no high or critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Security headers are properly configured
- [ ] No sensitive data in codebase
- [ ] Error messages don't expose system information
- [ ] Input validation is implemented for all user inputs
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced in production
- [ ] Security documentation is updated

## Third-Party Security

### Dependencies

We regularly monitor and update our dependencies for security vulnerabilities using:
- npm audit
- GitHub Dependabot
- Manual security reviews

### CDN and External Resources

All external resources are loaded from trusted CDNs with:
- Subresource Integrity (SRI) checks where possible
- HTTPS enforcement
- Fallback mechanisms for CDN failures

## Compliance

This project aims to comply with:
- OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
- GDPR requirements for data protection
- Industry best practices for web application security

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as:
- **Patches**: For critical vulnerabilities
- **Minor versions**: For high-priority security improvements
- **Major versions**: When security changes require breaking changes
