# Prompt Structure & Anatomy

Understanding the building blocks of effective prompts is crucial for consistent AI interactions. This guide breaks down prompt anatomy and provides frameworks for structuring your instructions.

## The CLEAR Framework

Use the **CLEAR** framework to structure your prompts:

- **C**ontext - Set the scene and background
- **L**ength - Specify output length requirements  
- **E**xamples - Provide samples when needed
- **A**ction - Define the specific task
- **R**esults - Describe the expected output format

### CLEAR in Practice

```python
# Context
"""You are a senior software architect reviewing system design proposals."""

# Length  
"""Provide a detailed review of 800-1000 words."""

# Examples
"""
Example feedback format:
‚úÖ Strengths: [list key strengths]
‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns: [list potential issues]
üí° Recommendations: [specific suggestions]
"""

# Action
"""Review the attached microservices architecture design focusing on scalability, maintainability, and security."""

# Results
"""Structure your response as a formal architectural review with sections for strengths, concerns, and recommendations."""
```

## Essential Prompt Components

### 1. Role Assignment

Define who the AI should act as to set appropriate context and expertise level.

**Basic Role:**
```python
"You are a data scientist..."
```

**Advanced Role with Context:**
```python
"""You are a senior data scientist at a Fortune 500 retail company with 
10+ years of experience in customer behavior analysis and predictive modeling. 
You specialize in turning complex data insights into actionable business strategies."""
```

**Multiple Roles:**
```python
"""You are wearing two hats:
1. Technical architect - ensuring scalability and performance
2. Business analyst - considering cost and resource implications"""
```

### 2. Task Definition

Be specific about what you want the AI to accomplish.

**Vague Task:**
```python
"Help me with my presentation"
```

**Clear Task:**
```python
"""Create an outline for a 20-minute presentation on AI ethics for 
a non-technical executive audience, including key talking points, 
potential Q&A topics, and suggested visual aids."""
```

**Multi-Step Task:**
```python
"""Please complete these steps in order:
1. Analyze the provided customer feedback data
2. Identify the top 5 recurring issues
3. Categorize issues by severity (High/Medium/Low)
4. Suggest specific action items for each high-severity issue
5. Create a summary report for stakeholder review"""
```

### 3. Context Setting

Provide relevant background information that influences the output.

**Temporal Context:**
```python
"""Context: This is for our Q4 2024 board meeting, following a challenging 
year with supply chain disruptions and market volatility."""
```

**Audience Context:**
```python
"""Target audience: Technical leads who are familiar with cloud architecture 
but new to Kubernetes deployment strategies."""
```

**Situational Context:**
```python
"""Situation: Our startup just raised Series A funding and needs to scale 
from 10 to 50 engineers in 6 months while maintaining code quality."""
```

### 4. Format Specifications

Define exactly how you want the output structured.

**Simple Format:**
```python
"Format your response as a numbered list with brief explanations."
```

**Structured Format:**
```python
"""
Format your response using this structure:

## Executive Summary
[2-3 sentence overview]

## Key Findings
- Finding 1: [description and impact]
- Finding 2: [description and impact]

## Recommendations
1. **Immediate Actions** (0-30 days)
2. **Short-term Goals** (1-3 months)  
3. **Long-term Strategy** (3-12 months)

## Next Steps
[Specific action items with owners]
"""
```

**Template Format:**
```python
"""Use this exact template for each product review:

**Product:** [name]
**Category:** [category]
**Rating:** [1-5 stars]
**Pros:** [3-4 bullet points]
**Cons:** [2-3 bullet points]  
**Best For:** [target user type]
**Price Value:** [justify rating]
"""
```

### 5. Constraints and Parameters

Set clear boundaries and requirements.

**Length Constraints:**
```python
"""
- Executive summary: exactly 100 words
- Main content: 800-1200 words
- Conclusion: 50-75 words
"""
```

**Style Constraints:**
```python
"""
Writing style requirements:
- Professional but conversational tone
- Use active voice
- Avoid jargon unless defined
- Include relevant statistics
- Write for 8th-grade reading level
"""
```

**Content Constraints:**
```python
"""
Constraints:
- Focus only on open-source solutions
- Budget limit: $50,000 annually
- Must integrate with existing Salesforce system
- Compliance with GDPR and CCPA required
"""
```

## Advanced Structural Patterns

### 1. Hierarchical Prompting

Break complex tasks into hierarchical components.

```python
"""
Primary Goal: Create a comprehensive marketing strategy

Level 1: Strategy Framework
- Market analysis
- Competitive positioning
- Target audience segmentation

Level 2: Tactical Plans (for each Level 1 item)
- Specific initiatives
- Resource requirements
- Success metrics

Level 3: Implementation Details (for high-priority tactics)
- Week-by-week action plans
- Responsible parties
- Dependencies and risks
"""
```

### 2. Conditional Logic

Use if-then statements for complex scenarios.

```python
"""
Analyze this code and provide feedback based on these conditions:

IF the code is a beginner's project:
- Focus on fundamental concepts and best practices
- Provide encouraging feedback with learning resources
- Suggest incremental improvements

IF the code is production-level:
- Emphasize security, performance, and maintainability
- Flag potential issues with severity levels
- Recommend architectural improvements

IF the code has security vulnerabilities:
- IMMEDIATELY flag all security issues
- Provide secure alternatives with examples
- Explain the risks in business terms
"""
```

### 3. Multi-Perspective Analysis

Request analysis from different viewpoints.

```python
"""
Evaluate this business proposal from three perspectives:

üè¢ Executive Perspective:
- Strategic alignment
- ROI and financial impact
- Risk assessment

üë®‚Äçüíª Technical Perspective:
- Implementation complexity
- Resource requirements
- Technical risks and dependencies

üë• User Perspective:
- User experience impact
- Adoption challenges
- Training and support needs

For each perspective, provide specific concerns and recommendations.
"""
```

## Prompt Optimization Techniques

### 1. Specificity Ladder

Start broad, then add specificity in layers.

**Level 1 (Basic):**
```python
"Write about customer service"
```

**Level 2 (Targeted):**
```python
"Write a guide about customer service for SaaS companies"
```

**Level 3 (Specific):**
```python
"Write a customer service playbook for B2B SaaS companies with 100+ enterprise clients, focusing on technical support escalation procedures"
```

**Level 4 (Highly Specific):**
```python
"""Create a customer service playbook for B2B SaaS companies serving 100+ enterprise clients.

Focus Areas:
- Technical support escalation (L1‚ÜíL2‚ÜíL3)
- SLA management and communication
- Enterprise client relationship protocols
- Knowledge base optimization

Format: Operations manual with process flows, templates, and metrics
Audience: Customer success managers and support team leads
Length: 3000-4000 words with actionable checklists"""
```

### 2. Progressive Enhancement

Build prompts by adding enhancement layers.

**Base Prompt:**
```python
"Explain machine learning algorithms"
```

**+ Audience:**
```python
"Explain machine learning algorithms for business executives"
```

**+ Context:**
```python
"Explain machine learning algorithms for business executives considering AI implementation"
```

**+ Format:**
```python
"Explain machine learning algorithms for business executives considering AI implementation, structured as a decision-making framework"
```

**+ Examples:**
```python
"""Explain machine learning algorithms for business executives considering AI implementation, structured as a decision-making framework.

Include real-world examples like:
- Netflix recommendation systems
- Fraud detection in banking  
- Predictive maintenance in manufacturing"""
```

## Common Structural Mistakes

### 1. Buried Instructions
**Problem:** Key instructions hidden in long text
**Solution:** Put critical requirements at the beginning or end

### 2. Conflicting Requirements
**Problem:** Asking for "brief but comprehensive" analysis
**Solution:** Prioritize requirements and be specific about trade-offs

### 3. Unclear Success Criteria
**Problem:** No way to evaluate if the output meets expectations
**Solution:** Define specific, measurable success criteria

### 4. Missing Context Hierarchy
**Problem:** All information treated with equal importance
**Solution:** Clearly indicate what's most important
