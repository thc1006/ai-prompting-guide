### 3. Include Examples
```python

Generate product descriptions following this example:

Example:

```

## Testing Your Prompts

### Quick Quality Check
1. **Clarity**: Can someone else understand what you want?
2. **Specificity**: Are your requirements detailed enough?
3. **Format**: Is the desired output format clear?
4. **Constraints**: Are limitations properly defined?
5. **Examples**: Would examples improve understanding?

### Iteration Framework
1. Start with a basic prompt
2. Test with sample inputs
3. Identify gaps in output quality
4. Add specific requirements
5. Test again and refine

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Over-complication**: Keep prompts as simple as possible while being specific
- **Ambiguous instructions**: Be clear about format, length, and requirements
- **Missing context**: Provide necessary background information
- **Inconsistent formatting**: Use the same structure for similar tasks
- **Ignoring constraints**: Always specify limitations and requirements
