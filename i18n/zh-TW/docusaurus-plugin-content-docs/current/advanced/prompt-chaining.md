# Prompt Chaining & Workflows

Learn to create sophisticated AI workflows by connecting multiple prompts in sequence, enabling complex multi-step processes and maintaining context across interactions.

## Understanding Prompt Chaining

Prompt chaining involves breaking complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps where the output of one prompt becomes the input for the next. This approach improves reliability, enables specialized processing, and allows for better quality control.

### Basic Chaining Structure

```python
"""
Workflow: [Overall Task Description]

Step 1: [Initial Processing]
Input: [Raw data/requirements]
Output: [Structured intermediate result]

Step 2: [Refinement/Analysis]  
Input: [Output from Step 1]
Output: [Enhanced or analyzed result]

Step 3: [Final Synthesis]
Input: [Output from Step 2]
Output: [Final deliverable]
"""
```

### Benefits of Chaining

- **Quality Control**: Each step can be validated before proceeding
- **Specialization**: Each prompt optimized for specific task
- **Error Isolation**: Problems can be identified and fixed at specific steps
- **Scalability**: Complex workflows become manageable
- **Reusability**: Individual chain components can be reused

```

## Chain Quality Control

### Validation Checkpoints

Between each chain step, validate:
- **Output Quality**: Does output meet requirements?
- **Context Preservation**: Is important information maintained?
- **Logical Consistency**: Do results make sense?
- **Completeness**: Are all requirements addressed?
- **Accuracy**: Are facts and calculations correct?

### Error Handling

```python
"""
ERROR HANDLING PROTOCOL:

IF Chain Output is Incomplete:
→ Retry with enhanced prompt specificity
→ Request missing information explicitly
→ Provide additional context if needed

IF Chain Output is Inconsistent:
→ Review previous chain outputs for conflicts  
→ Clarify requirements and constraints
→ Re-run problematic chain with corrections

IF Chain Output Quality is Low:
→ Analyze prompt clarity and specificity
→ Add examples or templates
→ Increase context or reduce complexity

Always validate critical outputs before proceeding to next chain.
"""
```

## Implementation Best Practices

### Chain Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each chain step should have one clear purpose
2. **Clear Interfaces**: Define exact input/output formats
3. **Maintainable Complexity**: Keep individual steps manageable
4. **Reusable Components**: Design chains that can be reused
5. **Quality Gates**: Build in validation and error handling

### Documentation Standards

```python
"""
CHAIN DOCUMENTATION TEMPLATE:

Chain Name: [Descriptive Name]
Purpose: [What this chain accomplishes]
Prerequisites: [Required inputs and conditions]
Steps: [Detailed step descriptions]
Outputs: [Expected deliverables]
Quality Criteria: [Success measures]
Error Handling: [What to do when things go wrong]
