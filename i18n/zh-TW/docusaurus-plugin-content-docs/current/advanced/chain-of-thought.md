- **Business strategy development**
- **Technical troubleshooting**
- **Creative problem-solving**

## Mathematical Problem Solving

### Advanced Mathematical CoT

```python
"""
Solve this optimization problem using chain-of-thought reasoning:

Problem: A company needs to determine the optimal pricing strategy for a new product. They have manufacturing costs of $50 per unit, market research shows demand follows the function D(p) = 1000 - 10p (where p is price), and they want to maximize profit.

Let me work through this systematically:

Step 1: Define the variables and objective function
- Let p = selling price per unit
- Manufacturing cost = $50 per unit
- Demand function: D(p) = 1000 - 10p
- Profit per unit = p - 50
- Total profit = (p - 50) × D(p)

Step 2: Set up the profit function
- Revenue = p × D(p) = p × (1000 - 10p) = 1000p - 10p²
- Total cost = 50 × D(p) = 50 × (1000 - 10p) = 50,000 - 500p
- Profit function: P(p) = Revenue - Total cost
- P(p) = (1000p - 10p²) - (50,000 - 500p)
- P(p) = 1000p - 10p² - 50,000 + 500p
- P(p) = -10p² + 1500p - 50,000

Step 3: Find the maximum profit point
- Take derivative: P'(p) = -20p + 1500
- Set equal to zero: -20p + 1500 = 0
- Solve for p: p = 1500/20 = 75

Step 4: Verify this is a maximum
- Second derivative: P''(p) = -20 (negative, confirms maximum)

Step 5: Calculate maximum profit and demand
- Optimal price: $75
- Demand at optimal price: D(75) = 1000 - 10(75) = 250 units
- Maximum profit: P(75) = -10(75)² + 1500(75) - 50,000 = $6,250

Therefore: The optimal pricing strategy is $75 per unit, resulting in 250 units sold and maximum profit of $6,250.

### Statistical Analysis CoT

```python
"""
Analyze this A/B testing scenario with chain-of-thought reasoning:

Scenario: An e-commerce site tested two checkout processes:
- Version A: 1,000 visitors, 120 conversions (12% rate)
- Version B: 1,000 visitors, 140 conversions (14% rate)

Is this difference statistically significant at 95% confidence?

Let me analyze this step by step:

Step 1: Set up the hypothesis test
- H₀: p₁ = p₂ (no difference in conversion rates)
- H₁: p₁ ≠ p₂ (there is a difference)
- Significance level: α = 0.05

Step 2: Calculate sample statistics
- Version A: n₁ = 1000, x₁ = 120, p₁ = 0.12
- Version B: n₂ = 1000, x₂ = 140, p₂ = 0.14
- Observed difference: p₂ - p₁ = 0.14 - 0.12 = 0.02

Step 3: Calculate pooled proportion and standard error
- Pooled proportion: p̂ = (x₁ + x₂)/(n₁ + n₂) = (120 + 140)/(1000 + 1000) = 0.13
- Standard error: SE = √[p̂(1-p̂)(1/n₁ + 1/n₂)]
- SE = √[0.13 × 0.87 × (1/1000 + 1/1000)] = √[0.1131 × 0.002] = 0.0151

Step 4: Calculate test statistic
- z = (p₂ - p₁)/SE = 0.02/0.0151 = 1.32

Step 5: Determine critical value and conclusion
- For α = 0.05 (two-tailed), critical value = ±1.96
- |z| = 1.32 < 1.96, so we fail to reject H₀
- p-value = 2 × P(Z > 1.32) ≈ 0.187

Therefore: The difference is NOT statistically significant. We need more data or a larger effect size to detect a meaningful difference with confidence.

- File storage and sharing
- Push notifications
- Load balancing and routing

Step 3: Design messaging infrastructure
- WebSocket connections for real-time communication
- Message brokers for reliable delivery (Apache Kafka/Redis Streams)
- Connection servers to handle WebSocket termination
- Need horizontal scaling: ~1000 concurrent connections per server = 1000 servers
- Geographic distribution: Deploy in multiple regions

Step 4: Plan data architecture
- User data: PostgreSQL with read replicas
- Message storage: Time-series database (ClickHouse/Cassandra)
- Session management: Redis for active connections
- File storage: Object storage (S3) with CDN
- Search functionality: Elasticsearch for message history

Step 5: Address scalability patterns
- Microservices architecture with API Gateway
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
- Database sharding by user_id or room_id
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Auto-scaling groups based on connection count

Step 6: Plan infrastructure deployment
